    "The rivers will always flow, and time will never truly stop; it keeps moving forward even when we wish it would pause. Seasons change, cities shift, people grow, and yet through all of it, one thing in me has remained constant. The love I have for you has never ceased. No matter how long it has been, no matter how far the world has taken us, it continued quietly, faithfully, even in the silence of a year apart.",
        "There was a time when we lost each other. A whole year of distance, of separate paths, of learning and enduring life in different places. And yet, even in that space, my heart never learned how to unlove you. It never learned how to replace you. It simply carried you gently, not with bitterness, not with regret, but with hope and gratitude for having known you throughout those years my love.",
        "My Dearest Angelica, I want you to know how proud I am of you.",
        "Proud of every achievement you reached in Manila while I wasn’t beside you. Proud of the strength you showed when things were difficult. Proud of the silent battles you fought, the tears you wiped away on your own, the ache you endured while still choosing to move forward. I may not have been there physically to witness every late night, every exhaustion, every doubt you conquered, but I see it now. I see your growth. I see your resilience. And I admire you more than words can hold.",
        "Every accomplishment you earned was not just success, it was proof of your courage. Every tear you shed was not weakness, it was evidence of how deeply you care and how fiercely you try. You stood on your own, in a city that demands strength, and you bloomed. Even when it hurt. Even when it was lonely. Even when I wasn’t there to hold your hand.",
        "And I am genuinely, wholeheartedly proud of you. Not in a possessive way. Not in a way that says “you are mine.” But in a way that says, “Look at the woman you are becoming.” You are strong. You are capable. You are brilliant. You are someone who continues to rise even when the weight of the world presses down.",
        "Loving you has never been about control or holding you back. It has always been about wanting to see you shine, even if that shining happened miles away from me.",
        "But now, here we are again.",
        "After a year of distance, of growth, of separate journeys, we found our way back to each other. And that, to me, feels like something sacred. Not rushed. Not forced. But chosen. We are not the same people we were before. We are stronger. Wiser. Softer in the right places. More aware of what it means to love intentionally.",
        "I am happy, Angelica. Truly happy. Not just because we are back together, but because we are back together after learning how to stand on our own. We chose each other again, not out of loneliness, not out of habit, but out of understanding.",
        "You have always had a throne in my heart. Even when parts of me changed, even when life broke pieces of who I was, that place for you never cracked, never shifted, never faded. It was always yours from the very beginning.",
        "Through every season we faced, the closeness, the distance, the silence, and the reunion, I truly believe God’s hand was gently guiding us. Even when we did not understand His timing, He was protecting you, covering you with His grace in Manila, strengthening you when you felt alone, and surrounding you with unseen protection. His love never left your side. In every tear you cried and every victory you achieved, He was there, shaping you into the woman you are becoming.",
        "You are deeply loved, Angelica, not only by me, but by a God who sees your heart fully. He knows your sacrifices, your hidden fears, your quiet prayers. His grace has carried you through moments you thought you wouldn’t survive, and His plans for you are greater than any distance or delay. I thank Him for protecting you when I couldn’t, for sustaining you when I wasn’t there, and for allowing our paths to cross again under His perfect will.",
        "There were also moments when you were sick, when your body felt weak and you were not in your best health. I am sorry that I was not there to hold your hand, to bring you medicine, or to sit beside you until you felt better. It hurt me knowing you were unwell and I could only care from a distance. But I am deeply grateful that God placed good friends around you, people who checked on you, stayed with you, and made sure you were not alone. Thank you for staying strong even in those fragile days.",
        "This Valentine’s Day is not just about romance. It is about gratitude. Gratitude for your strength. Gratitude for your perseverance. Gratitude that the Lord allowed our paths to cross again. Gratitude that after everything, we still found our way home to each other.",
        "Wherever life takes us next, I want you to know this: I will always be your supporter. Your safe place. The one who celebrates your wins loudly and stands beside you quietly when the world feels heavy. I will always be proud of you, not only for what you achieve, but for who you are when no one is watching.",
        "The rivers will continue to flow. Time will continue to move. But if there is one thing I am certain of, it is this, my love for you has endured seasons, distance, and silence. And now that we stand together again, I cherish you not only with passion, but with understanding.",
        "Happy Valentine’s Day, My Dearest Angelica."
